RUNNING THE SHELL

Run "make"
Execute by using "./a.out"
Type "exit" to exit the shell


Internal commands  : ‘cd’, ‘echo’, ‘history’, ‘pwd’ and ‘exit’.

      Cd

    • "cd .." - goes to previous directory
    • "cd ~" goes to ~/
      It shows the path before and after the changes.
      
      Echo

    • "echo" - prints empty line
    • echo text - prints "text"
    • echo -E "text"  - prints "text" without spacing
      
      Pwd
    • prints present working directory(or the path)
	
	History
    • prints the history of commands that we used
      
External commands : ‘ls’, ‘cat’, ‘date’, ‘rm’ and ‘mkdir’

      ls

    • ls- prints all the files in the directory

    • ls -l : prints all the files in list form
      

      cat “filename”

    • prints content of the file

      
      date 

    • date : prints current date

    • date -u : prints date in UTC format
      

      rm “1”
      
    •  remove file named 1
      

      mkdir filename
      
    • makes file with name filename



To handle these commands, the shell starts a new process, using fork and then execute the command using family of execl commands. It then waits for the child process to complete, using the waitpid function.
